Visit `http://localhost:5000` and:
1. **Onboarding Flow**: Chat with the Onboarding Agent
2. **Team Matching**: Get AI-powered team recommendations
3. **Performance Dashboard**: View real-time team metrics
4. **Coaching Insights**: Receive personalized development advice

## üé™ Demo Script for Judges

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Find Your Team solves a critical global problem: millions of talented people in poor communities can't find teams where they can maximize their impact. Our platform uses a 3-agent AWS architecture to connect people with their purpose and the teams where they can add the most value to the people they love."

### Technical Demo (2 minutes)
1. **Show Onboarding Agent**: "Watch as our Onboarding Agent, powered by Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet, builds a comprehensive Purpose Profile through empathetic conversation."

2. **Demonstrate Matching**: "The Matching Agent uses OpenSearch vector embeddings to find perfect team matches based on values, skills, and community impact potential."

3. **Team Performance**: "The Team Agent continuously monitors performance and provides coaching insights using Lambda action groups."

### Impact Story (30 seconds)
"This isn't just about technology - it's about human potential. Imagine a talented developer in rural Kenya who wants to help their community access clean water. Our platform connects them with a global team working on water access solutions, providing both purpose and income."
