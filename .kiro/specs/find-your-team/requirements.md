# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Find Your Team (FYT) is a free, open-source, purpose-driven social-professional network powered by Generative AI Agents that ensures no human talent is wasted or underutilized. The platform connects individuals based on their values, passions, and work styles to form high-performing teams that add maximum value to the people they love by doing what they love and are good at.

The mission is to make it extremely hard for people and teams NOT to use this platform by providing such compelling value that adoption becomes inevitable. The platform addresses critical barriers to human potential - connectivity limitations, talent discovery challenges, and team formation inefficiencies - through a resilient, multi-protocol communication system that works in any condition.

The solution leverages a three-agent architecture using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to deliver personalized onboarding, intelligent matching, and continuous team performance coaching. The platform is designed to be universally accessible, irresistibly engaging, and infinitely scalable while maximizing human potential and community impact.
