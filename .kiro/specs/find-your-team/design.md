# Design Document

## Overview

Find Your Team (FYT) is architected as a free, open-source, resilient multi-agent platform that leverages Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for orchestrating three specialized AI agents. The system is designed to maximize human potential utilization by making it irresistibly valuable for individuals and teams to connect, collaborate, and contribute their best work to the people they love.

The architecture follows a microservices pattern with event-driven communication, ensuring each component can scale independently while maintaining system coherence through the central Insight Database and agent orchestration layer. The platform is designed to be self-sustaining through community contributions and optional enterprise services while remaining completely free for individual users.

**Core Design Principles:**
- **Universal Access**: Works offline, online, and in low-bandwidth conditions
- **Irresistible Value**: Provides such compelling benefits that non-adoption becomes irrational  
- **Community-Driven**: Open-source with transparent development and governance
- **Human-Centric**: Optimizes for human fulfillment and potential maximization
- **Local Impact**: Enables communities to become more effective and self-sufficient

### Multi-Agent System Design

The three-agent architecture is orchestrated through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, with each agent having specialized responsibilities and data access patterns:

1. **Onboarding Agent**: Conversational AI focused on empathetic profile building
2. **Matching Agent**: RAG-powered system for contextual team matching
3. **Team Agent**: Performance monitoring and coaching system with tool execution capabilities

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Progressive Web App (PWA) Frontend

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build optimization
- Workbox for service worker management
- IndexedDB for local storage
- PeerJS for WebRTC implementation

**Key Features:**

}

interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: number;
  protocol: 'mqtt' | 'webrtc' | 'queued';
  encrypted: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Communication Infrastructure

**AWS IoT Core MQTT Broker:**

- Zero-server dependency for local team collaboration

**Message Queue Architecture:**
```typescript
interface MessageQueue {
  queuedMessages: ChatMessage[];
  syncStatus: 'online' | 'offline' | 'syncing';
  lastSync: timestamp;
  compressionEnabled: boolean;
}
```

### 4. Data Architecture

**Amazon DynamoDB (Primary Database):**
```json
{
  "UserProfiles": {
    "PartitionKey": "userId",
    "Attributes": {
      "purposeProfile": "Object",
      "skillsMatrix": "Object",
      "performanceMetrics": "Object",
      "teamHistory": "List"
    }
  },
  "TeamPerformance": {

- Enables contextual matching based on unstructured data
- Supports real-time similarity search with sub-second response times

### 5. Agent Tool Integration

**Lambda Action Groups:**
```python
# Team Agent Tools
def check_project_status(team_id: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieve current project metrics and status"""
    
def generate_retrospective(team_id: str, period: str) -> dict:
    """Create customized team retrospective report"""
    
def update_performance_metrics(team_id: str, metrics: dict) -> bool:
    """Update team performance data in Insight Database"""
    
def provide_coaching_insight(user_id: str, context: dict) -> str:
    """Generate personalized coaching recommendation"""
```

## Data Models

interface PurposeProfile {
  userId: string;
  values: {
    core: string[];
    secondary: string[];
    weights: Record<string, number>;
  };
  workStyle: {
    collaboration: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    autonomy: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    structure: 'flexible' | 'moderate' | 'structured';
    communication: 'direct' | 'diplomatic' | 'supportive';
  };
  skills: {
    technical: SkillLevel[];
    soft: SkillLevel[];
    leadership: SkillLevel[];
  };
  passions: string[];
  confidenceScore: number;
  lastUpdated: timestamp;
}
```

interface TeamPerformance {
  teamId: string;
  members: string[];
  metrics: {
    productivity: number;
    collaboration: number;
    satisfaction: number;
    goalAchievement: number;
  };
  trends: {
    period: string;
    improvement: number;
    challenges: string[];
    successes: string[];
  };
  agentRecommendations: CoachingInsight[];

}
```

    explanation: XAIExplanation;
    requirements: string[];
    benefits: string[];
  }[];
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  nextSteps: string[];
}
```

## Error Handling

### Resilient Communication Strategy

**Network Failure Handling:**
1. **Connection Loss**: Automatic fallback to local storage queuing
2. **Partial Connectivity**: MQTT store-and-forward with compression
3. **Agent Unavailability**: Graceful degradation with cached responses
4. **Data Sync Conflicts**: Last-write-wins with user notification

**Agent Error Recovery:**
```typescript
interface AgentErrorHandler {
  retryPolicy: {
    maxRetries: number;
    backoffStrategy: 'exponential' | 'linear';
    timeoutMs: number;
  };
  fallbackBehavior: {
    onboardingFallback: 'cached_questions' | 'simplified_flow';
    matchingFallback: 'basic_algorithm' | 'manual_browse';
    teamFallback: 'static_tips' | 'peer_feedback';
  };
  errorReporting: {
    logLevel: 'error' | 'warn' | 'info';
    cloudWatchIntegration: boolean;
    userNotification: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Data Consistency and Validation

**Profile Validation:**
- Confidence score thresholds before agent handoffs
- Data integrity checks on profile updates
- Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
- Backup and recovery procedures for critical data

**Performance Metric Validation:**
- Anomaly detection for unusual performance changes
- Cross-validation of team metrics across multiple sources
- Audit trails for all Team Agent database updates
- Data quality monitoring and alerting

## Testing Strategy

### Multi-Agent System Testing

**Agent Integration Testing:**
1. **Handoff Validation**: Test successful transitions between agents
2. **Memory Consistency**: Verify conversation context preservation
3. **Tool Execution**: Validate Lambda action group functionality
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure response times and accuracy

**End-to-End User Journey Testing:**
```typescript
describe('Complete User Journey', () => {
  test('Onboarding to Team Assignment', async () => {
    // 1. User completes onboarding with Onboarding Agent
    // 2. Profile achieves â‰¥90% confidence score
    // 3. Matching Agent finds suitable opportunities
    // 4. User joins team and Team Agent activates
    // 5. Performance metrics show improvement over time
  });
});
```
